# Building Instagram from Scratch Using React, Tailwind CSS, Firebase

I've built this app using React (Custom Hooks, Context), Firebase & Tailwind CSS. 
The application has the following pages : login, sign up, dashboard &  the user profile page.
I've made some pages public and some private using auth listeners. 

- I used Tailwind CSS for this project because I find it easier too use, and more controlled.
- I have 3 custom hooks: an authListener, use-photos, and use-user.
- I have protected-route- so if the user is logged in, they can move through the app, and if they are not- I take them to the login page.
- The user has the ability to like and comment on posts.
